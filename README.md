CS5412 Cloud Computing Project

## Requirements
Azure Functinos requires node version 14. One way you can acheive that is by using `nvm`, a tool for managing node versions.

## How to run
First you need to put the `Secrets` directory at the root of the project directory.
Then run Azure Functions by `cd`ing into the directory.

Add needed dependencies with
``` sh
npm install
```

Then run the Azure Functions locally in terminal with:
``` sh
npm start
```
